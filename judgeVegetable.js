/*
a function called judgeVegetable()that will decide which vegetable is best based on a given judging characteristic. Our function will receive two parameters: a list of veggies(as an array of objects), and a characteristic to judge the veggies by (in the case of a tomato, either redness or plumpness).

Our function must return the name of the person who submitted (vegetables.submitter) the vegetable with the highest ranking in the provided category.
